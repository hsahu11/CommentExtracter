'Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand.'  'So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker.'  'Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this.'  "This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water  nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples  straight out of the camera."  'The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7   I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range  better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charm'  'GCam7+ Redmi Note 8=‚ô•Ô∏èüî•'  'The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the endü§ó'  'Display:- The FullHD+ screen  yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone  the screen is bright  vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better.'  "Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well  without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all."  'Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins.'  'Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better.'  'Extra Features:-'  'IR blaster ‚úîÔ∏è'  'Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel  premium built and scratch resistant‚úîÔ∏è'  'Self cleaning speaker‚úîÔ∏è'  'Wireless FM‚úîÔ∏è'  'P2i coating‚úîÔ∏è'  'USB C‚úîÔ∏è'  'Fast 18W charger in the box‚úîÔ∏è'  'Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your device'  'Very very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales.'  'Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do  from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back  with downright best camera in this segment  to the presence of great speakers  to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster  Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.'  'If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it‚úåÔ∏è'  'Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit.'
