The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.'  '2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.'  "3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor  it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625."  '4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.'  '5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.'  '6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.'  '7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.'  'Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy\n'  '\n  \n']","5","AGS55M4MC7M44SUQOUONG74HJ27Q","155"
