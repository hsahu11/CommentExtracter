Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.'  "Grabbed it for 15 999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount."  "But  ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby."  'Small review as per my knowledge -'  'On-hand  its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5")'  'Comparing to Nord  we have Memory card slot - no dependency.'  'While updating the phone on first start  i felt bit heat. But later  it was fine.'  'Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).'  'Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.'  'Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord  better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.'  'Settings - an ocean of settings  wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.'  "But  doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)"  'No option to find app usage statistics.'  'Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.'  'Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.'  'Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.'  'Has Slowmo  Super slowmo  Hyperlapse  Panaroma.'  'AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.'  "Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable."  'Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.'  'EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine '  'just on 10th day of my purchase  my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken üíî'  'Handle with care.\n'  '\n  \n']","5","AHGBJCSEA744JYYVEJ3DHWLIWYTA","162"

The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.'  'Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies  occasional checking of mails  light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.'  'Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.'  "Processor and UI: For the last 3 days  that I've been using this phone  UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover  so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5."  'Display: No comments. Just 5/5.'  "The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing  when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered."
